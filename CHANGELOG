2019-11-8:
Accuweather changed their hourly forecast page layout, script corrected. Thanks to morfik, ector1935 and unklar for their feedback and support.

2019-10-17:
Made the script (current weather section) a bit more international. I've also switched to curl and solved the VPN problem, at least with Expressvpn that is.

2019-10-14:
Corrected the curr_cond file after Accuweather's new tricks. Unfortunately, we've lost the Ceiling value from the current weather conditions, I hope it wasn't too important, whatever it was.

2019-10-13:
Pushed everything to a brand new repository, the old one had been massacred beyond recognition. I also changed the name of the script and the script's folder to accuweather and Accuweather_conky_script respectively. The number naming scheme made no sense because problems would arise when new scripts where created or old ones abandoned. It's also a great distraction from the fact that I suck at git.

2019-10-10:
The good news: Fixed the visibility in the curr_cond file. No issue with me with the forecast_0.png.
The bad news: The user agent that used to work with expressvpn doesn't do a thing any more. I've also screwed up the repository a bit but I think I've managed to bring it back to its former state (mostly). Please report any abnormalities you encounter.

2019-10-8:
Curr_cond file in the Accuweather script corrected.

2019-10-7:

Thanks to loutch for his feedback.

2019-10-6:
Tiny correction to the Accuweather script, thanks to loutch for reporting the bug that caused the hourly_raw1 and hourly_raw2 files to be the same. Script corrected and pushed to git.
You can either pull it or go to line 440 of the script and change

2019-10-2: Changed from w3m to wget again, with a twist...

2019-9-9:Final Release

2019-9:
-Fixed some conkyrc files which showed the wrong temperatures and forecast phrases.
-Changed the conkyrc files to use a color code, ie ${color1} and not a specific color.
-Sometimes the script downloads the forecast for more than 15 days. New version cuts down to 15 days.
